# Arduino Nano handheld game console

This is Nanoboy Basic, an Arduino Nano based handheld game console.

The repository contains 2 sketches:

* Sokoban like game - remake of the game "Move the box" from the old Siemens A55
* Bomberman - basic version of the NES game "Bomberman"

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Arduino Nano
* 1.8 in Display (160x128)
* MicrodSD / SD card socket
* Buzzer
* 6 Momentary switches
* Resistors: one of each : 220, 390, 680, 1k, 2.2k, 4.7k, 10k ohms
* male and female header pin strips
* some short cables
* test board

### Build

* **Gamepad**

    First lets make a game controller.
For more details check this [link](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=8558.0).</br>
We need a piece of test board to solder the buttons and the resistors like this:</br></br>
![](Readme-res/buttons.png)</br>
The gray boxes are the buttons.</br>
The gold ones are the resistors:

  * 1 - 220 ohms
  * 2 - 390 ohms
  * 3 - 680 ohms
  * 4 - 1k ohm
  * 5 - 2.2k ohms
  * 6 - 4.7k ohms
  * 7 - 10k ohms

  Red wire is connected to Arduinoâ€™s 5V pin, black to GND and blue to A0.</br>
When the circuit is closed we read the value at pin A0.</br> Value ranges:

  * 1 = [837, 838]</br>
  * 2 = [733, 736]</br>
  * 3 = [609, 610]</br>
  * 4 = [316, 318]</br>
  * 5 = [174, 178]</br>
  * 6 = [89, 91]</br>
  * 3 + 4 = [671, 674]

* **Main board**

    Solder the female header pins like this:</br>

We need to connect the pins as following:</br>
![](Readme-res/mainboard2.png)

| **Lcd** | **Arduino** |
| --- | --- |
| VCC | 5V |
| GND | GND |
| CLK/SCK | D13 |
| SDA | D11 |
| RS/DC | D9 |
| RST | D8 |
| CS | D10 |
|**SD Card** ||
|CS | D4 |
|MOSI | D11 |
|CLK | D13 |
|MISO | D12 |
|**Buzzer** ||
|+ | D7 |
|- | GND|

Finished mainboard:</br>

### Dependencies

For the lcd to work we need a couple of libraries:

* [Adafruit_GFX.h](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library)
* [Adafruit_ST7735.h](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-ST7735-Library)

### Usage

Open the sketch you want with Arduino IDE and upload it.
